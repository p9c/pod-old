Package btcutil provides bitcoin-specific convenience functions and types.

A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality. See `test_coverage.txt` for the gocov coverage report. Alternatively, if you are running a POSIX OS, you can run the `cov_report.sh` script for a real-time report.

This package was developed for pod, an alternative full-node implementation of bitcoin which is under active development by Conformal. Although it was primarily written for pod, this package has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a standalone package for any projects needing the functionality provided.

## Installation and Updating
