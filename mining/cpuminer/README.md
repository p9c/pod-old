## Overview

This package is currently a work in progress. It works without issue since it used in several of the integration tests, but the API is not really ready for consumption as it has simply been refactored out of the main codebase for now.

## Installation and Updating

```bash
$ go get -u git.parallelcoin.io/pod/mining/cpuminer
```
